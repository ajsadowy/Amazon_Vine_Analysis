# Amazon_Vine_Analysis   
## Overview   
### Purpose   
For this analysis our objective was to come to a conclusion on whether reviews from Amazon's Vine program are reliable based on determining if their is a bias factor between Vine memeber reviews and Non-Vine member reviews.   
From the 50 datasets to choose from I picked the Electronics category to analyze.   


## Results

From the data set we see following:   
* that the ratio of Vine members : Non-Vine members is close to 1:50 (1080:49659),   
* the same ratio is applied to 5 star reviews that were given by both (454:23034),   
* the percentage of each group giving 5 star reviews is 42% Vine members and 46% Non-Vine members.   

## Summary   
Based on the similar percentage of the ratio of users (Vine : Non-Vine) and 5 star reviews from said users. If there is a major difference in the percentage of 5 star reviews/total reviews then this is potential evidence of biases in the reviews. The question would be is the bias in favored and disfavored and why. However with the percentages being 42% among Vine memebers and 46% among Non-Vine members the data appears to be neutral for both.   
   
A follow up study may be on for specific products within the categories and cataloging key phrases used in the reviews.
